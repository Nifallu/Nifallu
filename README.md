### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Before App Academy, I did a bit of everything, including a stint at Harbor Freight where I went from a sales associate to a Sales Supervisor. Leading a team taught me a lot about collaboration and getting things done, and it was during this time that it significantly contributed to my personal growth.

My journey into software engineering kicked off during my Computer Animation days. PyMel, a language for Maya, was a game-changer. Coding became a joy, injecting life into animations. Life threw some curveballs during part-time Computer Science education, but here I am, reigniting that coding spark.

App Academy has been quite a ride. I've soaked up languages, sharpened problem-solving, and learned the art of debugging. But hey, there's more to me than code. Iâ€™m your go-to for customer service, love sharing what I know, and can navigate leadership roles.

Projects? I love tweaking and perfecting code. Itâ€™s like giving a painting that final touch.

Dream company? Imagine a place where we play with the latest tech, learn together, and craft user experiences that people love.

Beyond tech, you'll find me in the worlds of crochet, sewing, video games, and anime. It's not just code; it's about balancing creativity and tech.

What sets me apart? Iâ€™m all about growing quietly. Challenges are my thing, and I bring a low-key enthusiasm to any team or project. Letâ€™s make coding an art, right?
